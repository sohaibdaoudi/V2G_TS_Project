## Overview

This project presents an intelligent energy management system that leverages Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology to optimize electricity production costs. Using deep learning methods, we forecast key energy components and provide decision support for when to utilize stored energy from Electric Vehicles (EVs) versus supplementing with diesel generation.

The system integrates real-world solar irradiance data from MeknÃ¨s, Morocco, along with residential load profiles representative of Moroccan consumption patterns. Our Streamlit application delivers weekly forecasts and cost-optimization recommendations based on comprehensive time series analysis.

## V2G Explained

### What is Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)?

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) is a cutting-edge technology enabling bidirectional energy flow between electric vehicle batteries and the power grid. Unlike conventional EV charging, V2G allows vehicles to not only consume electricity but also return it to the grid when beneficial.

## Streamlit App Components

Our interactive web application provides a user-friendly interface for energy management decision support:

### Key App Modules

- **data_utils.py**: Functions for loading and preprocessing time series data
- **model_utils.py**: Handles model loading and prediction generation
- **optimization.py**: Implements cost optimization algorithms
- **visualization.py**: Creates interactive charts and data visualizations
- **utils.py**: General utility functions used throughout the application

### App Features

- Weekly forecasts for load, solar production, and V2G availability
- Cost comparison between V2G utilization and diesel generation
- Interactive visualizations of energy patterns
- Optimization recommendations for energy sourcing

When connected to a V2G-enabled charging station, the system manages electricity flow through:

1. **Charging Mode:** The EV draws power from the grid to charge its battery
2. **Discharging (V2G) Mode:** The EV feeds stored energy back to the grid when:
   - Grid demand peaks 
   - Energy prices are high
   - Renewable energy generation is low

This process is coordinated through sophisticated control systems with EV owner consent, typically including financial incentives for participation.

### V2G Use Cases

V2G technology offers multiple benefits across the energy ecosystem:

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Peak Shaving** | Reduces grid strain during high-demand periods by supplying stored EV energy |
| **Grid Stabilization** | Provides ancillary services like frequency regulation and voltage support |
| **Renewable Integration** | Stores surplus renewable energy for use when generation is insufficient |
| **Emergency Backup** | Offers potential backup power during outages |
| **Economic Optimization** | Creates revenue opportunities for EV owners through energy arbitrage |

Our project specifically focuses on cost optimization by determining when V2G utilization is more economical than alternative generation sources.
