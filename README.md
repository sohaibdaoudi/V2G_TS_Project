This project focuses on optimizing electricity production costs by intelligently integrating Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. We have adapted a foundational MATLAB & Simulink V2G simulation to model longer timeframes (monthly) and incorporate real-world solar irradiance data from Mekn√®s, Morocco, along with a generated residential load profile representative of Moroccan consumption patterns.

The core output is a Streamlit-based web application designed to provide weekly forecasts. This application assists users in making informed decisions about whether to utilize stored energy from Electric Vehicles (EVs) via V2G or to supplement power generation with diesel, based on a comprehensive optimization study.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Details

The core simulation, located in the `Simulation/` folder, is an adapted version of a standard V2G system model. Key modifications include:

* **Extended Time Horizon:** Simulation runs for monthly periods instead of 24 hours.
* **Component Modification:** Removal of the wind farm component from the original model.
* **Data Inputs:**
    * Solar Irradiance: Specific data for Mekn√®s.
    * Residential Load: Custom-generated data reflecting Moroccan usage patterns.
* **Key Outputs:**
    * Total Residential Load
    * Solar Energy Production
    * Total Power Available from EV V2G

## üöÄ Streamlit Application

The Streamlit application serves as the user interface for the optimization system. Its primary functions are:

1.  **Displaying Weekly Forecasts:** Visualizing anticipated energy supply and demand.
2.  **Providing Recommendations:** Advising on whether to:
    * Utilize energy stored in EVs (V2G).
    * Purchase diesel fuel to cover potential energy deficits.
    These recommendations are based on the outputs of the optimization study.

### Prerequisites for Running the App

* Python (version specified in badges, e.g., 3.9+)
* Streamlit (version specified in badges, e.g., 1.20+)
* Other Python packages (list them in a `requirements.txt` file)

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
