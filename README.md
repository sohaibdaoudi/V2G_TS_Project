**üöß Project Status: Under Development üöß**

## üìñ Overview

This project focuses on optimizing electricity production costs by intelligently integrating Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. We have adapted a foundational MATLAB & Simulink V2G simulation (see "Acknowledgements" section) to model longer timeframes (monthly) and incorporate real-world solar irradiance data from Mekn√®s, Morocco, along with a generated residential load profile representative of Moroccan consumption patterns.

The core output is a Streamlit-based web application designed to provide weekly forecasts. This application assists users in making informed decisions about whether to utilize stored energy from Electric Vehicles (EVs) via V2G or to supplement power generation with diesel, based on a comprehensive optimization study.

##  V2G Explained

**What is Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)?**

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) is a technology that enables bi-directional energy flow between an electric vehicle's (EV) battery and the power grid. In simpler terms, it allows EVs not only to draw electricity from the grid to charge their batteries but also to send electricity back to the grid when needed.

**How does it work?**

When an EV is plugged into a V2G-enabled charging station, specialized hardware and software manage the flow of electricity.
1.  **Charging:** The EV charges its battery as usual.
2.  **Discharging (V2G Mode):** When the grid requires extra power (e.g., during peak demand hours or when renewable energy generation is low), or when it's economically beneficial, the V2G system can draw stored energy from the EV's battery and feed it back into the grid.
This process is controlled by an aggregator or a utility company, often with the EV owner's consent and potentially with financial incentives for participation.

**When is V2G used?**

V2G can be particularly useful in several scenarios:
* **Peak Shaving:** Discharging EV batteries during peak demand periods to reduce strain on the grid and potentially lower electricity costs for utilities (and consumers).
* **Grid Stabilization:** Providing ancillary services like frequency regulation and voltage support to maintain grid stability.
* **Renewable Energy Integration:** Storing excess renewable energy (e.g., solar power during the day) and discharging it when renewables are not generating (e.g., at night).
* **Emergency Backup Power:** In some configurations, V2G-enabled vehicles could provide backup power during outages.
* **Cost Optimization:** EV owners or fleet managers can potentially earn revenue by selling energy back to the grid or reduce their overall energy costs.

Our project leverages V2G to optimize energy costs by deciding when it's more economical to use stored EV energy versus other sources like diesel generators.

## üöÄ Streamlit Application

The Streamlit application serves as the user interface for the optimization system. Its primary functions are:

1.  **Displaying Weekly Forecasts:** Visualizing anticipated energy supply and demand.
2.  **Providing Recommendations:** Advising on whether to:
    * Utilize energy stored in EVs (V2G).
    * Purchase diesel fuel to cover potential energy deficits.
    These recommendations are based on the outputs of the optimization study.
